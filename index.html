                <h2>Founder of Metarobos</h2>
                <p>With over 11 years of experience as a Data Engineer, I have excelled especially in the challenging environment of the financial market, where dealing with random data and uncertain forecasts, as is characteristic of the stock market, becomes a daily task. My profound understanding and ability to work under pressure, with an unwavering focus on results, has allowed me to create robust models centered on capital smoothing and portfolio management. I am the creator of several innovative techniques applied to my investment robot, and over the years, I have become an advocate for automation in the financial market, being recognized as a pioneer in this field in Brazil.</p>
